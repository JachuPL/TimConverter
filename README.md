Tim Converter
===========

This is a simple script that converts tim's packer xml files into DaRealFreak unpacker tool list

Almost everything is done, I'll apply some bugfixes and commit here asap.

What is JachuPL define statement and why it won't work for you:
This define statement indicates that script can use my LogTracer library, which is not available for now.
Compiling this code with defined "JachuPL" will fail.
